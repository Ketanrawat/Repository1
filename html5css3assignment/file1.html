        <p>Suppose we want someone to place a string of flowers around, say,
        a picture of Lord Krishna, we must not say to them,
        “Put these flowers on the picture of Lord Krishna.”
        We should instead say, “Place these flowers around Lord Krishna's neck.”
        We must realise that the Lord resides in the pictures that we have put up for
         worship.
